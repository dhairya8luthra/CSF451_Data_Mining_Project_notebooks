Credit Card Fraud Detection using Outlier detection and classification algorithms

In our pursuit of addressing the critical issue of fraud detection, our primary
focus is to leverage advanced data mining techniques for a comprehensive
analysis aimed at identifying and preventing fraudulent activities. By
harnessing the power of data mining, we aim to provide credit card
companies with sophisticated tools and methodologies to scrutinize
transactions effectively. The overarching goal is to enable these financial
institutions to swiftly recognize and mitigate the impact of fraudulent
credit card transactions. Our initiative is driven by the commitment to
safeguard the financial interests of customers, ensuring they are not unjustly
charged for items they did not authorize or purchase.
